    <li>How does virtualization relate to Cloud Computing?</li>
    <p>These terms are often used interchangeably.  However, they are not the same thing.</p>
    <p>Virtualization is a component within Cloud Computing.  You use it to separate the <i>Operating System</i> from the underlying hardware.</p>
    <p>Cloud Computing is a much larger concept than Virtualization.  You use this to separate the <i>Application</i> from the underlying hardware</p>
    <li>In a virtualization context, what is an Operating System instance?</li>
    <p>In virtualization, an Operating System instance is an instance of an Operating System installed on the hypervisor layer of a server, instead of the physical layer.  These are self-contained Operating Systems that can be copied, moved, and deleted easily. </p>
    <li>Is it difficult to move instances between different hardware units?</li>
    <p>No, it is not difficult.  Thanks to virtualization, you can install the same hypervisor on the new hardware unit and move instances between the hardware units very easily.</p>
    <li>On a Type 1 Hypervisor, how would you manage the O/S instances?</li>
    <p>For Type 1 (or "native" or "bare metal") hypervisors, you start with a blank server with no Operating System and install the hypervisor.  You then install the Operating System instances onto the hypervisor from another networked computer with Management Software using a Management Console.</p>
    <li>According to Eli, how much does a Type 1 Hypervisor usually cost?</li>
    <p>The hypervisor software itself is usually free from the vendor.  There are free basic versions of Management Software, but more robust Management Software is often very expensive.</p>
    <li>What cautions does Eli have concerning networking and Type 2 Hypervisors?</li>
    <p>Type 2 (or "hosted") hypervisors are installed onto an Operating System itself on a physical computer.  You can then install Operating System instances into that hypervisor.</p>
    <p>The problem with using a Type 2 hypervisor for networking is that if you are going to be using the host computer for other things (e.g. web surfing, gaming, Outlook), the network traffic from the virtual servers can get mixed up and cause problems.</p>
